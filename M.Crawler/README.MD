**Crawler Challenge**

The goal of this challenge is to implement a C# console application that displays the words that are the most used in a portion of a webpage.

***Requirements***

The code should be written in C# and .Net Core (or .Net Framework).
The executable build from that code should return the top 10 words and how often they’re used in the section of the page.
Bonus points:
-top is configurable
-certain words can be excluded from the count

***Page to crawl***

Only words from the section “history” should be accounted for.
